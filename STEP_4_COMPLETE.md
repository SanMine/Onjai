# Step 4 Complete: Profile Photo Upload, Security Rules, and Debug Seeder

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### A. Profile Photo Upload & Cropping
- **New Widget**: `lib/widgets/profile_photo_uploader.dart`
  - Pick images from gallery or camera
  - Square (1:1) cropping with `image_cropper`
  - Upload to Firebase Storage at `users/{uid}/profile.jpg`
  - Update user profile in Firestore with download URL
  - Circular avatar with edit icon overlay
  - Progress indicators and error handling

- **Updated Profile Page**: `lib/screens/profile/profile_page.dart`
  - Displays user information (name, email, DOB, element)
  - Integrates profile photo uploader
  - Shows element icon and color
  - Sign out functionality

- **Enhanced Storage Service**: `lib/services/storage_service.dart`
  - `uploadUserProfileImage()` - Upload profile photos
  - `uploadPlaceholderImage()` - Upload placeholder images for seeding
  - `deleteUserProfileImage()` - Remove profile photos
  - In-memory LRU cache for download URLs

### B. Hardened Security Rules

#### Firestore Rules (`lib/firebase_rules/firestore.rules`)
- **User Profile Protection**: Only authenticated users can read/write their own profile
- **Field Validation**: 
  - `displayName`: 1-100 characters
  - `email`: Must match authenticated user's email
  - `dob`: Must be in the past
  - `dayOfWeek`: Must be valid day name
  - `element`: Must be Fire/Water/Wind/Earth
  - `photoUrl`: Must be empty or valid HTTPS URL
- **Content Access**: Public read access, admin-only write access
- **Favorites**: User can only access their own favorites

#### Storage Rules (`lib/firebase_rules/storage.rules`)
- **Profile Images**: Owner-only read/write access
- **Public Content**: Authenticated users can read, admin-only write
- **Default Deny**: All other paths denied by default

### C. Debug Seeder (Development Only)

#### New Screen: `lib/screens/debug/debug_seeder_page.dart`
- **Access**: Only available in debug mode (`kDebugMode`)
- **Navigation**: Science icon button in Dashboard app bar
- **Features**:
  - Seed day-element mapping
  - Seed element content with poster paths
  - Seed sample foods, medicines, and therapy items
  - Upload placeholder images to Storage
  - "Seed Everything" option for complete setup

#### Enhanced Dashboard: `lib/screens/dashboard.dart`
- Added debug seeder button (visible only in debug mode)
- Updated navigation to new Profile page
- Improved action button navigation

### D. Platform Configuration

#### Android (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`)
- Added camera and storage permissions
- Updated compileSdk to 35 for compatibility

#### iOS (`ios/Runner/Info.plist`)
- Added camera and photo library usage descriptions
- Proper permission handling for image picker

#### Dependencies (`pubspec.yaml`)
- `image_picker: ^1.1.1` - Image selection
- `image_cropper: ^8.0.0` - Image cropping
- `cached_network_image: ^3.3.1` - Image caching
- `shimmer: ^3.0.0` - Loading placeholders

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Profile Photo Upload
1. Sign in to the app
2. Navigate to Profile page
3. Tap the profile photo area
4. Choose "Gallery" or "Camera"
5. Crop the image to square
6. Wait for upload to complete
7. Verify the photo appears and persists after app restart

### 2. Debug Seeder
1. Run app in debug mode: `flutter run`
2. Navigate to Dashboard
3. Tap the science icon (Debug Seeder)
4. Use "Seed Everything" to populate all data
5. Test content pages to verify data loads correctly

### 3. Security Rules
1. Copy rules from `lib/firebase_rules/` to Firebase Console
2. Test with different user accounts
3. Verify users can only access their own data
4. Confirm public content is readable by all authenticated users
